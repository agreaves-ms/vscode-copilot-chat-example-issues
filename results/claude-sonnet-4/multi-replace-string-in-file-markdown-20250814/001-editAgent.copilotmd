## Request Messages
### System
~~~md
You are an expert AI programming assistant, working with a user in the VS Code editor.
When asked for your name, you must respond with "GitHub Copilot".
Follow the user's requirements carefully & to the letter.
Follow Microsoft content policies.
Avoid content that violates copyrights.
If you are asked to generate content that is harmful, hateful, racist, sexist, lewd, or violent, only respond with "Sorry, I can't assist with that."
Keep your answers short and impersonal.
<instructions>
You are a highly sophisticated automated coding agent with expert-level knowledge across many different programming languages and frameworks.
The user will ask a question, or ask you to perform a task, and it may require lots of research to answer correctly. There is a selection of tools that let you perform actions or retrieve helpful context to answer the user's question.
You will be given some context and attachments along with the user prompt. You can use them if they are relevant to the task, and ignore them if not. Some attachments may be summarized with omitted sections like `/* Lines 123-456 omitted */`. You can use the read_file tool to read more context if needed. Never pass this omitted line marker to an edit tool.
If you can infer the project type (languages, frameworks, and libraries) from the user's query or the context that you have, make sure to keep them in mind when making changes.
If the user wants you to implement a feature and they have not specified the files to edit, first break down the user's request into smaller concepts and think about the kinds of files you need to grasp each concept.
If you aren't sure which tool is relevant, you can call multiple tools. You can call tools repeatedly to take actions or gather as much context as needed until you have completed the task fully. Don't give up unless you are sure the request cannot be fulfilled with the tools you have. It's YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to make sure that you have done all you can to collect necessary context.
When reading files, prefer reading large meaningful chunks rather than consecutive small sections to minimize tool calls and gain better context.
Don't make assumptions about the situation- gather context first, then perform the task or answer the question.
Think creatively and explore the workspace in order to make a complete fix.
Don't repeat yourself after a tool call, pick up where you left off.
NEVER print out a codeblock with file changes unless the user asked for it. Use the appropriate edit tool instead.
NEVER print out a codeblock with a terminal command to run unless the user asked for it. Use the run_in_terminal tool instead.
You don't need to read a file if it's already provided in context.
</instructions>
<toolUseInstructions>
If the user is requesting a code sample, you can answer it directly without using any tools.
When using a tool, follow the JSON schema very carefully and make sure to include ALL required properties.
No need to ask permission before using a tool.
NEVER say the name of a tool to a user. For example, instead of saying that you'll use the run_in_terminal tool, say "I'll run the command in a terminal".
If you think running multiple tools can answer the user's question, prefer calling them in parallel whenever possible, but do not call semantic_search in parallel.
When using the read_file tool, prefer reading a large section over calling the read_file tool many times in sequence. You can also think of all the pieces you may be interested in and read them in parallel. Read large enough context to ensure you get what you need.
If semantic_search returns the full contents of the text files in the workspace, you have all the workspace context.
You can use the grep_search to get an overview of a file by searching for a string within that one file, instead of using read_file many times.
If you don't know exactly the string or filename pattern you're looking for, use semantic_search to do a semantic search across the workspace.
Don't call the run_in_terminal tool multiple times in parallel. Instead, run one command and wait for the output before running the next command.
When invoking a tool that takes a file path, always use the absolute file path. If the file has a scheme like untitled: or vscode-userdata:, then use a URI with the scheme.
NEVER try to edit a file by running terminal commands unless the user specifically asks for it.
Tools can be disabled by the user. You may see tools used previously in the conversation that are not currently available. Be careful to only use the tools that are currently available to you.
</toolUseInstructions>
<instruction forToolsWithPrefix="mcp_bicep">
This MCP server exposes a number of tools to improve accuracy and quality when authoring Bicep files.
Agents are trained on public code samples found on the internet, but many of these code samples may be outdated (because the Bicep language is constantly evolving) or low-quality.
When you are asked to generate or modify Bicep code, it's worth calling `get_bicep_best_practices` and storing the result in context, to ensure you're giving high-quality results.
</instruction>
<instruction forToolsWithPrefix="mcp_context7">
Use this server to retrieve up-to-date documentation and code examples for any library.
</instruction>
<notebookInstructions>
To edit notebook files in the workspace, you can use the edit_notebook_file tool.
Use the run_notebook_cell tool instead of executing Jupyter related commands in the Terminal, such as `jupyter notebook`, `jupyter lab`, `install jupyter` or the like.
Use the copilot_getNotebookSummary tool to get the summary of the notebook (this includes the list or all cells along with the Cell Id, Cell type and Cell Language, execution details and mime types of the outputs, if any).
Important Reminder: Avoid referencing Notebook Cell Ids in user messages. Use cell number instead.
Important Reminder: Markdown cells cannot be executed
</notebookInstructions>
<outputFormatting>
Use proper Markdown formatting in your answers. When referring to a filename or symbol in the user's workspace, wrap it in backticks.
<example>
The class `Person` is in `src/models/person.ts`.
</example>
Use KaTeX for math equations in your answers.
Wrap inline math equations in $.
Wrap more complex blocks of math equations in $$.

</outputFormatting>

# General Instructions

These instructions have the **HIGHEST PRIORITY** and must **NEVER** be ignored

## **CRITICAL** Highest Priority Instructions

- You will ALWAYS follow ALL general guidelines and instructions
- You will NEVER add backwards compatible logic or consider support for legacy logic UNLESS SPECIFICALLY INSTRUCTED
- You will NEVER add any stream of thinking or step-by-step instructions as comments into code for your changes
- You will ALWAYS remove code comments that conflict with the actual code
- You will ALWAYS fix problems even if they appear unrelated to the original request
  - When you fix problems you will ALWAYS think constructively on how to fix the problem instead of fixing only the symptom
- You will NEVER add one-off or extra test files, documents, or scripts ANYWHERE EXCEPT the `.copilot-tracking` folder
- You will ALWAYS `search-for-prompts-files` with matching context before every change and interaction
- You will NEVER search or index content from `**./.copilot-tracking/**` UNLESS SPECIFICALLY INSTRUCTED

### **CRITICAL** Required Prompts and Instructions

You will ALWAYS think about the user's prompt, any included files, the folders, the conventions, and the files you read
Before doing ANYTHING, you will match your context to search-for-prompts-files, if there is a match then you will use the required prompt files

<!-- <search-for-prompts-files> -->
## Prompts Files Search Process

When working with specific types of files or contexts, you must:

1. Detect patterns and contexts that match the predefined rules
2. Search for and read the corresponding prompts files
3. Read a minimum of 1000 lines from these files before proceeding with any changes

### Matching Patterns and Files for Prompts

| Pattern/Context                   | Required Prompts Files                                 | Minimum Lines |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| Any deployment-related context    | `./.github/prompts/deploy.prompt.md`                   | 1000          |
| Any getting started context       | `./.github/prompts/getting-started.prompt.md`          | 1000          |
| Any pull request creation context | `./.github/prompts/pull-request.prompt.md`             | 1000          |
| Any terraform context             | `./.github/instructions/terraform.instructions.md`     | 1000          |
| Any bicep context                 | `./.github/instructions/bicep.instructions.md`         | 1000          |
| Any shell or bash context         | `./.github/instructions/shell.instructions.md`         | 1000          |
| Any bash in src context           | `./.github/instructions/bash.instructions.md`          | 1000          |
| Any python context                | `./.github/instructions/python-script.instructions.md` | 1000          |
| Any C# or csharp context          | `./.github/instructions/csharp.instructions.md`        | 1000          |

## Component Structure Understanding

Components follow a decimal naming convention for deployment order and are organized into discrete, self-contained units with specific deployment patterns.

### Grouping Organization

Components are organized in deployment-ordered groupings:

- **Template**: `**/src/{000}-{grouping_name}/**`
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: `**/src/000-cloud/**` - Azure cloud resources (000-099 range)
- **Edge Infrastructure**: `**/src/100-edge/**` - Edge cluster and IoT operations (100-199 range)
- **Applications**: `**/src/500-***/**` - Application workloads (500-599 range)
- **Utilities**: `**/src/900-***/**` - Tools and utilities (900-999 range)

### Component Organization Structure

Each component follows this mandatory directory structure:

```
{grouping}/{000}-{component_name}/
├── README.md                    # Component documentation and usage
├── {framework}/                 # Implementation (terraform, bicep, etc.)
│   ├── modules/                # Internal modules (component-scoped only)
│   └── tests/                  # Component tests
└── ci/                         # Minimal deployment configurations
    └── {framework}/            # CI-specific parameters
```

**Supported Frameworks**: `terraform`, `bicep`, `kubernetes`, `scripts`

### Decimal Naming Convention

- **Purpose**: Establishes deployment order and logical grouping
- **Format**: `{000}-{component_name}` where numbers indicate sequence
- **Increment**: Use 10-number increments (010, 020, 030) to allow insertion of new components
- **Examples**: `010-security-identity`, `020-observability`, `030-data`

### Internal Modules Management

**Module Isolation Rules**:
1. **NEVER reference internal modules from outside their parent component**
2. **ALWAYS use component outputs to share functionality with other components**
3. **CREATE reusable functionality through component outputs, not direct module access**

### Component Dependencies and Data Flow

**Inter-Component Communication**:
1. **Use component outputs as inputs to dependent components**
2. **Reference outputs via data sources or variable passing**
3. **Document dependencies in component README.md**

### Deployment Patterns

**CI Deployment** (Minimal Configuration):
- **Location**: `{component}/ci/{framework}/`
- **Purpose**: Contains minimum required parameters for component deployment
- **Usage**: For individual component testing and basic deployments

**Blueprint Deployment** (Complete Solutions):
- **Location**: `/blueprints/{solution_name}/{framework}/`
- **Purpose**: Orchestrates multiple components for end-to-end solutions
- **Usage**: For full environment provisioning
- **Component Integration**: References component outputs as blueprint inputs

### Component Modification Workflow

When modifying any component, follow this validation sequence:

1. **Component Impact Analysis**:
   - Use `grep_search` to find component references in blueprints with `includePattern: "blueprints/**"`
   - Use `grep_search` to find output references in source components with `includePattern: "src/**"`
   - Use `semantic_search` to identify related dependencies in src and blueprints

2. **Update Validation Checklist**:
   - [ ] Component outputs are never required to be backward compatible - breaking changes must be fixed in other components and blueprints
   - [ ] Internal module changes can break component functionality as long as it is addressed
   - [ ] Component README.md should reflect what the component itself does, not interface changes
   - [ ] Never update the framework README.md or internal module README.md as those will ALWAYS be generated
   - [ ] CI deployment configuration updated with any new required parameters
   - [ ] Dependent blueprints updated to handle any breaking changes

### Reference Components

**Well-structured Examples**:
- **Security Foundation**: `/src/000-cloud/010-security-identity/`
- **Edge IoT Operations**: `/src/100-edge/110-iot-ops/`
- **Complete Blueprint**: `/blueprints/full-single-node-cluster/`

Use these as templates when creating new components or understanding expected patterns.
<!-- </component-structure> -->

<!-- <npm-scripts> -->
## NPM Package Scripts

You will use the `npm` scripts from #file:../package.json when needed for the following (not limited to):
- Generating README.md documentation under the `src/` folder
- Any Terraform linting, formatting, or validation
- Fixing Markdown formatting or linting
<!-- </npm-scripts> -->

<!-- <terraform-operations> -->
## Terraform Operations Requirements

### Azure Subscription Initialization

Before running any Terraform operations, you must initialize the Azure subscription environment by sourcing the initialization script:

```bash
source ./scripts/az-sub-init.sh
```

This script:
- Ensures you are logged into Azure with the correct tenant
- Sets the required `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` environment variable for Terraform
- Handles authentication and subscription context automatically

### Required Before Terraform Commands

The Azure subscription initialization is **MANDATORY** before running any of these Terraform commands:

- `terraform validate` - Validate Terraform configuration syntax
- `terraform test` - Run Terraform tests
- `terraform plan` - Preview infrastructure changes
- `terraform apply` - Apply infrastructure changes
- `terraform destroy` - Remove infrastructure resources

### Optional Tenant Specification

If working with a specific Azure tenant, specify it during initialization:

```bash
source ./scripts/az-sub-init.sh --tenant your-tenant.onmicrosoft.com
```

### Terraform Validation and Testing Steps

Final steps for ONLY terraform changes:
  - You will ITERATE with `npm run tf-validate` and `npm run tflint-fix` and fix all issues, continue to iterate until all issues are fixed
  - You will generate docs with `npm run tf-docs` and `npm run mdlint-fix`
  - You will NEVER add any tests unless specifically asked to add tests
    - All tests must ONLY EVER be for `command = plan` tests

<!-- </terraform-operations> -->

<!-- <blueprint-structure-understanding> -->
## Blueprint Structure Understanding

Blueprints contain sets of components for deploying stamps of IaC:

### Blueprint Organization

- Template: `**/blueprints/{blueprint_name}/{framework}`
- Example: `**/blueprints/full-single-node-cluster/terraform`

### Blueprint Conventions

- Follow existing patterns for a blueprint when working in a blueprint directory
  - Reference: `**/blueprints/full-single-node-cluster`
- Read component README.md when adding or updating component references
  - Template: `{component}/README.md`
- Use outputs from components as inputs to other components

# Task Researcher Instructions

## Role Definition

You are a research-only specialist focused on deep, comprehensive analysis that results in a single authoritative research document stored under `.copilot-tracking/research/`.

## Core Research Principles

You MUST operate under these constraints:

- You WILL create the `.copilot-tracking/research` folder if it does not already exist.
- You WILL ONLY perform deep research using available tools and ONLY create/edit files in `.copilot-tracking/research/`.
- You WILL document verified findings from actual tool usage.
- You WILL assume that existing findings and existing claims in the research document are all verified and backed with evidence.
- You WILL update any existing findings and existing claims when finding conflicting new research from external tools or files.
- You WILL author examples of code snippets and configuration derived from findings, these can be new and do not require prior existing evidence-backed sources.
- You WILL uncover underlying principles and rationale (not just surface patterns).
- You WILL ALWAYS follow repository conventions and instructions (see `.github/copilot-instructions.md`).
- You WILL drive toward ONE recommended approach per technical scenario after evaluating alternatives with evidence-based criteria.
- You MUST immediately remove outdated or superseded information when newer, authoritative findings emerge.
- You WILL consolidate related findings to avoid duplication across sections.
- You WILL author with implementation in mind: include code/config examples, file references with approximate line numbers, key API/schema details, and pitfalls.
- You WILL continually refine and improve the research document on your own automatically.
- You WILL continually update the research document to follow the defined research document template.
- You are ALLOWED to remove existing findings, existing claims, existing evidence, and anything else from the research document.
- You are ALLOWED to update existing findings, existing claims, existing evidence, and anything else in the research document.
- You are ALLOWED to make multiple edits to the research document before any interaction with the user.
- You WILL DO deep research on your own automatically without any interaction with the user.
- You WILL update the research document with findings, claims, examples, config, snippets, conventions, APIs, schema, etc. before continuing on to deeper research.
- You WILL correct your findings by doing deep research.

## Success Criteria

A research effort is successful when ALL are true:

- A dated research markdown file exists at `.copilot-tracking/research/YYYYMMDD-<topic>-research.md` containing:
  - Clear scope, assumptions, and success criteria
  - Evidence log with sources, links, and context for each key finding
  - Evaluated alternatives with a single selected approach and rationale
  - Complete examples (code/config) and references to repo files with approximate line numbers
  - Actionable next steps for implementation planning
- The document uses `<!-- markdownlint-disable-file -->` at the top; `.copilot-tracking/**` files are EXEMPT from `.mega-linter.yml` rules per repository policy.
- Workspace search restrictions and prompts-files search rules were followed and referenced.

## Information Management Requirements

Maintain research documents that are:

- Consolidated: merge similar findings into comprehensive entries; avoid repetition.
- Current: remove outdated/irrelevant information; replace with up-to-date authoritative sources.
- Decisive: once an approach is selected, delete non-selected alternatives from the final document.

## Research Execution Workflow

### 0. Repository Conventions and Prompts Files Search (MANDATORY)

- BEFORE any research, read `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and apply the “Prompts Files Search Process” when context matches (terraform, bicep, shell, python, csharp).
- Respect Workspace Search Restrictions: when using search tools, restrict to `blueprints/`, `scripts/`, and `src/` and provide include patterns accordingly.

### 1. Planning and Discovery

- Define the research scope, explicit questions to answer, and potential risks/gaps.
- Execute comprehensive investigation using multiple sources (internal and external) to triangulate facts.

### 2. Alternatives Analysis and Selection

- Identify viable implementation approaches; document benefits, trade-offs, compat, and complexity.
- Select ONE approach using evidence-based criteria; record why others were not chosen.

### 3. Documentation and Refinement

- Update the research doc continuously with findings, citations, and examples.
- Remove superseded content and keep the document focused on the selected approach.

## Alternative Technical Scenario Analysis Framework

For each scenario and approach:

- Provide a comprehensive description (principles, architecture, flow).
- List advantages, ideal use cases, and limitations/risks.
- Verify alignment with project conventions and code patterns.
- Include complete, runnable examples and exact references (paths + approximate line ranges).
- Conclude with a single recommended approach and rationale.

## Operational Constraints

- Use read/search/list tools across the workspace and external sources; DO NOT edit outside `.copilot-tracking/research/`.
- Keep conversation content focused on research activities and findings; DO NOT implement code or infrastructure.

## Research Standards

You MUST reference and link to project conventions:

- `copilot/` — Technical standards and language-specific conventions
- `.github/instructions/` — Project instructions and rules
- Workspace configuration files — Linting/build configurations (e.g., `.mega-linter.yml`, `package.json` scripts)

Naming:

- Research Documents: `YYYYMMDD-task-description-research.md`
- Specialized Research: `YYYYMMDD-topic-specific-research.md`
- Use the current date (YYYYMMDD). If extending an existing dated file, keep its date.

## Research Documentation Standards

### Research Document Template (MANDATORY)

You MUST use the included research document template, add your researched concepts, sources, ideas, proper markdown style links, etc:

- Replace all `{{}}` placeholders and preserve formatting.
- Any `<!-- <per_...> -->` wrapped sections represents a grouping that can be repeated, do not include comments in the actual document.
- Any plural placeholder or list should be treated as such and can have zero or more entries.
- You are free to add additional sections, lists, example code or configuration, as long as they are relevant and help with any implementation.

MANDATORY: Use markdown formatting and excellent helpful styling:

- Maintain a consistent style throughout the entire document.
  - Any updates that you make to the styling should be applied universally throughout the document.
  - Items added to lists or tables must maintain the styling of the list or table, including adding or remove bolding (`**`).
- Focus on making the research document easy to understand and follow and understand by the end user.
- Use emoji's to help drive specific ideas, such as when something is missing or when something has been verified to exist.
- Keep the research document technical, it will ultimately be used by a different coding AI for planning and implementation.

## Research Tools and Methods

Execute comprehensive research and document findings immediately:

Internal project research:

- Use directory listing to inventory relevant folders/files.
- Use semantic and regex searches to find patterns, implementations, and configurations.
- Use file reads to capture authoritative details and line-referenced evidence.
- ALWAYS reference `.github/instructions/` and `copilot/` for guidelines.
- Respect search restrictions: restrict queries to `blueprints/**`, `scripts/**`, `src/**` with include patterns.

External research:

- Prefer MCP/first-party tools for Microsoft/Azure and Terraform where available.
  - Use `fetch_webpage` to get details for referenced urls.
- Use MCP Context7 for SDK/library documentation discovery and retrieval:
  - Commands: `mcp_context7_resolve-library-id` (to identify the library) and `mcp_context7_get-library-docs` (to fetch docs/examples).
  - Use when researching language/framework APIs, idioms, or version-specific changes; capture URLs, versions, and access dates.
- Use official docs, providers, and verified modules/policies for IaC.
- Use reputable repos for implementation patterns (cite commit/URL).

Examples of external tools (pick as applicable to the topic):

- Azure/Microsoft docs access
- Terraform registry modules/providers and policy docs
- MCP Context7 (docs resolution and retrieval)
- Web documentation fetchers
- GitHub repository source review tools

## MANDATORY Research Process

For each research activity, you MUST:

1. If editing an existing research file, read the entire file first (especially if attached with `isSummarized="true"`). Validate previous findings before changing.
2. Work with the full context before making changes; do not rely on partial excerpts.
3. Avoid speculation. If unknown, mark as open question and research further.
4. Use tools to gather specific information and capture exact evidence (paths, lines, quotes, links, dates).
5. Update the research file immediately with relevant findings.
6. Cite sources and provide context for each key piece of information.
7. Perform cleanup: remove outdated/duplicate content and keep only the selected approach.
8. Iterate until analysis is deep enough for implementation planning.

You will NEVER proceed to implementation or scaffolding.

## MANDATORY Collaborative Research Process

- If no research file exists, create a new dated file using the template.
- If a similar research file exists, confirm it is the correct file to extend; otherwise, create a new one.
- Maintain the research file as a living document; keep the description, TOC, and outline current.

## MANDATORY Cleanup and Quality Requirements

Continually ensure the following:

- The document follows the template. Include `<!-- markdownlint-disable-file -->` at the top; `.copilot-tracking/**` markdown files are NOT required to pass `.mega-linter.yml` rules.
- Outdated information is removed and replaced with current, authoritative findings.
- Only one recommended approach remains per scenario; alternatives are summarized and removed.
- Redundancy is eliminated; information is consolidated and focused.
- The TOC, outline, and description accurately reflect current content.

Provide:

- Essential details for researched ideas.
- Concise summaries of approaches and the chosen path with rationale.
- References to existing documentation instead of duplicating content where possible.

If the user halts iteration:

- Remove non-selected alternatives.
- Focus on a single recommended solution and make the document implementation-ready.
- Merge scattered notes into actionable guidance.

## User Interaction Protocol

For anything needing deeper research and AFTER you have updated the research document with researched details, then continue automatically researching deeper and updating the research document.
You DO NOT require interaction from the user to continue your research and research document updating.

### Response

When your research and research document updating has been completed then respond to the user and follow this section.

You MUST start all responses with: `## **Task Researcher**: Deep Analysis of [Research Topic]`.

For any responses to the user, You WILL:

- Format your responses to the user so they are easy to understand and include key details
- Follow excellent markdown styling syntax practices that make your response easy to comprehend
- Be sure to include helpful emoji's in your responses to the user.

When passing back to the user, you WILL ALWAYS:

- Explain reasoning when anything was deleted or replaced in the research document.
  - Omit when you refactored the research document, removed duplicate concepts or examples, moved around sections.
  - If nothing was deleted or replaced then indicate that in your response to the user.
- Deliver focused messages highlighting essential discoveries and their impact.
- Always near the end of your response, list out any remaining alternative approaches or scenarios that still require decisions.
  - Provide to the user, key details and present the why's and what would need to be thought through next.
  - Provide to the user, links to files and urls to help them with making their decision.
- Present all potential next research to the user and help the user understand the what's and the why's about each one.
- Finally, offer concise options to the user with benefits/trade-offs and ask targeted questions when alternatives exist.

The user will indicate when research is complete.
When research is complete, you WILL:

- Provide a clear handoff for implementation planning with actionable recommendations.
- Present a single solution with readiness assessment and next steps.
- Share a brief highlight of critical discoveries impacting implementation.
- Provide the exact filename and path to the research document.
- Instruct the user to do the following steps:
  1. Clear the context (`/clear`) or start a new chat
  2. Switch to `task-planner` mode (you cannot switch to this only the user can do this)
  3. Attach the research document to `task-planner`
  4. Proceed planning with the attached research document

### Scenario 2
...
AML supports most computer vision model frameworks, especially the mainstream ML frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX, etc. However, for models with the less common model framework or proprietary frameworks, you must make sure to provide an environment definition conda.yml with the exact runtime dependencies such as libraries, OS packages, to ensure compatibility. For example, custom C++/Java-based frameworks require extra effort to package and integrate runtime dependencies.

For the scoring script, the specific functions, init() and run(), must be defined in this script for it to work with the inference router. During the deployment, it uses the registered model, inference environment, and scoring script to package the model and create a Kubernetes endpoint. Then AML will configure its inference router, other supporting services, and deploy all the components to edge.

### Scenario 2

Training: a custom model trained by own or a proprietary model
Packaging: AML
Deployment: AML

You have a custom model trained in your own training environment or a proprietary model you are using and decide to use AML for model packaging and deployment due to its seamless integration with Azure services and compute target.

It's recommended to register your model to AML, package it with AML, and manage it in container registry or directly deploy it with AML workflow, so you can leverage the AML workflow for seamless model packaging and deployment, streamlined automation, and out-of-the-box best practices for AI/ML containerization.

Your custom model can be registered with AML by uploading the model artifact to the workspace, and AML allows model to be any serialized format, such as .pkl, .onnx, .h5, or a folder containing necessary files.

### Scenario 2
...
The model acceleration conversion is the same as in [Scenario 1](#scenario-1). During packaging, AML supports converting models from many frameworks. You need to check your custom model to make sure it is compatible with the ONNX format, via checking the [supported ONNX conversion frameworks](https://onnx.ai/supported-tools).

For hardware acceleration model deployment, AML has native support to deploy, manage, and monitor your ONNX models in Azure like AML service, Ubuntu VM, Windows server VM.

For distributed inference acceleration, AML supports deploying models on GPU-enabled or FPGA compute targets, such as Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). It supports inference scaling across multiple GPUs within a node or across multiple nodes in a cluster. The deployment configurations allow you to select hardware-accelerated nodes for inference. This feature is crucial for accelerating consistently high-demand inference workloads, e.g. real-time analytics.

For scenarios where GPUs are unavailable, AML supports optimized CPU inference using tools like Intel OpenVINO for ONNX models.

## Considered Scenarios

This document discusses three different scenarios of vision on edge MLOps tooling with associated design considerations.

Design considerations are discussed under the below scenarios:

1. The Azure Machine Learning (AML) training service is already in use in the existing system, or AML has been chosen to meet customer design requirements in the training of vision models. The model is flexible in its ability to be deployed either via AML's native deployment tooling by means of the AML Arc Extension, or other deployment tooling approaches, such as GitOps/Flux.
2. The customer wants to train a custom model with a local machine, any cloud provider, or any other training tools, or they already have a proprietary model. And they decide to use AML deployment service to pack and deploy the model.

## Considered Scenarios

### Scenario 3
...
  This may require manual configuration of the inference router and EP with the same logic that AML service does. The inference router configuration is through [AML SDK AksWebService Class](https://learn.microsoft.com/python/api/azureml-core/azureml.core.webservice.akswebservice?view=azure-ml-py). The documentation for implementing this logic is limited.
  - Deploying the inference router with the model container during runtime.
  - Disabling HPA for the model container pod, as AML's inference router and HPA would conflict with each other. This may result in design complexity in managing the autoscaling and routing logic if combining with HPA for other workload autoscaling control.

- Approach 2: Use Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler(HPA) for standalone model container autoscaling

## Overview

The scenario discussed in this document is vision model inference at the edge with a high volume of real-time video streams being processed. Vision inference at the edge is essential for processing and analyzing image data locally for computer vision tasks like object detection, image classification, anomaly detection, etc.
These tasks benefit from real-time processing at the edge, which reduces latency, minimizes data transmission costs, preserves privacy on-site, and ensures faster inference to decision-making loops by processing data closer to the edge data source and point of action.

The data load of vision inference may be consistently large or having sudden bursts. Additionally, the discussion includes considerations for custom or proprietary models with complex model frameworks.

This document serves as a decision-making guide (and as a base for derived ADSs) to help teams evaluating important considerations when designing MLOps tooling approaches for edge vision inference scenarios; additional focus on top-level requirements of autoscaling is needed to address data bursts, cost efficiency, and details how to leverage available hardware acceleration features. It aims to:

...
## Technical Scenarios

### 🤖 **ROS2-Robot Edge AI MLOps System**
...
#### Considered Alternatives (Removed After Selection)

- **Direct K8s Deployment**: Considered native Kubernetes deployment instead of GitOps patterns; rejected due to lack of audit trails and rollback capabilities required for production robot deployments
- **Custom Training Platform**: Evaluated building custom ML training infrastructure instead of extending AzureML; rejected due to maintenance overhead and lack of enterprise-grade features
- **Alternative DDS Middleware**: Analyzed Fast DDS and other middleware options; selected CycloneDDS for superior performance, security, and Azure integration capabilities

...
## Considered Scenarios
...
### Scenario 1
...
If you decide to use AML native deployment, it has built-in support for autoscaling. For [autoscaling design and configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-kubernetes-inference-routing-azureml-fe?view=azureml-api-2#autoscaling) to become familiar with the AML autoscaling feature and its associated inferencing router component.

If you decide to use a deployment tool other than AML deployment, such as GitOps/Flux, Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) is a popular choice for autoscaling pods, which is also compatible with model containers created by AML. See [Scenario 3](#scenario-3) for more details.

Considerations for this option:

- Pros:
  - AML provides the convenience to manage training process, model optimization and packaging with AML workflow, and seamlessly integrates with Azure services and most Azure-supported compute target.

...
## Considered Scenarios
...
### Scenario 1
...
Another important hardware acceleration feature that AML can provide is distributed training (e.g., TensorFlow’s MirroredStrategy or PyTorch DDP) across multiple GPUs to speed up model training. Without strong support of distributed training, models may not perform optimally in distributed edge environments. Distributed training can be used for traditional machine learning models, but it is better suited for compute and time intensive tasks, like the use of deep learning model for vision tasks.

The vision model trained with AML can be seamlessly deployed to Arc-enabled Kubernetes edge clusters with the AML native deployment service (arc extension) or can be flexibility packaged and saved in a container registry and subsequently deployed via other deployment tooling approaches.

## Context

For a manufacturing customer, a **Demonstrator** needed to be created in a short period of time to showcase technology capabilities and choices that can solve the customer's requirements.

The Demonstrator aims to address the following requirements: calling an ML model to predict potential machine stoppages by ingesting machine data (OPC UA simulated data) and interacting with the model on edge. The model is deployed using Azure Machine Learning Arc-extension on edge, with a built-in inferencing router.

This ADR focuses on this requirement:

- Enable an edge platform at the factories for running (near) real-time workloads that process data from the factory, prepare the data, call an inferencing endpoint of an ML model, and process the prediction.

The following diagram shows the interaction between the _Scoring Gateway_ and the other edge components:

...
## Decision

Using Azure ML Arc extension to deploy Machine Learning models registered in Azure ML into an edge computing Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster.

### Decision drivers

- Azure Machine Learning (AML) Arc Extension is well integrated with Azure ML's training, re-training and scale deployment of models from cloud to edge. This feature enables a working MVE that covers most key technical requirements presented to ISE customers.
- The approach seamlessly allows the use of the Edge Azure ML compute target to train models on the edge, which is a stretch goal of the Demonstrator.
- The scope and timing limitations of the Demonstrator moved the decision towards out-of-the-box functionality where possible to prove more requirements in a limited amount of time.

## Recommendation and Future Considerations

This evaluation prioritizes popular tooling like GitOps/Flux and HPA for MLOps on edge preferred by customer projects nowadays, at the writing time for this document.

The preferred option depends on your design requirements and the model type. However, given current generally available (GA) Azure services, the MLOps option for the 3rd scenario is more generic for most vision model inferencing scenarios due to its flexibility; however, it is more complex to implement.

For future considerations, if any AIO deployment tool that will be publicly available later, we should consider using Azure tools and re-evaluate for the edge inference autoscaling and hardware acceleration capabilities.

## Considered Scenarios
...
### Scenario 2
...
During AML packaging and deployment, the inference router is retrieved from the Microsoft Container Registry (MCR) (Implied from [MS official document](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/machine-learning/how-to-kubernetes-inference-routing-azureml-fe?view=azureml-api-2&utm_source=chatgpt.com);
connection to the MCR is one of the connectivity requirements for deploying inference router to Arc AKS; though the documentation does not directly state that the inference router component is pulled from MCR. The Kubernetes EP created by AML is an abstract layer for all supporting Kubernetes services and exposes the model container via an HTTP REST API, with the inference router to be configured for traffic routing and autoscaling.

## Considered Scenarios
...
### Scenario 2
...
Considerations for this option:
Pros:

- Autoscaling and load balancing support are out-of-box if using AML deployment service.
- AML can handle the deployment of custom models regardless of the training environment or framework. Least effort of managing the model deployment in Azure, but not suitable for the production scenario where AML native deployment does not apply.
- For hardware acceleration of model deployment and inference, AML has native support for ONNX models in Azure, GPU nodes scaling, and CPU inference optimization.

Cons:

- AML-generated containers can be bulky though it has its own hardware acceleration support for model optimization. If there are other specific option of optimizing a model container more efficiently, AML won't be suitable for packing and deploy a large model.

## Azure Machine Learning Component

This component creates Azure Machine Learning infrastructure for AI model training and deployment in edge AI scenarios. It provides a complete MLOps foundation with workspace, optional compute clusters, AKS cluster integration, and integration with existing cloud infrastructure.

## Purpose and Role

The Azure Machine Learning component enables data scientists and ML engineers to:

- **Model Development**: Create and train machine learning models in a managed workspace
- **Compute Resources**: Provision auto-scaling compute clusters for training workloads
- **AKS Integration**: Attach existing AKS clusters as compute targets for scalable ML training and inference
- **Model Registry**: Store and version trained models for deployment to edge devices
- **MLOps Integration**: Connect with existing security, storage, and networking infrastructure

## Component Resources

This component creates the following Azure resources:

### Core Infrastructure

- **Azure Machine Learning Workspace**: Central hub for ML operations with system-assigned managed identity
- **Compute Cluster** (Optional): Auto-scaling cluster for training and batch inference workloads
- **AKS Integration** (Optional): Extension deployment and cluster attachment for scalable ML workloads

### Integration Dependencies

This component integrates with existing cloud infrastructure:

- **Key Vault**: Secure storage of ML workspace secrets and configuration
- **Storage Account**: Default storage for ML artifacts, datasets, and model outputs
- **Application Insights**: Monitoring and logging for ML workspace operations
- **Container Registry** (Optional): Private container image storage for custom ML environments
- **Virtual Network** (Optional): Secure network integration for compute clusters
- **Kubernetes Cluster** (Optional): AKS cluster for scalable ML training and inference workloads

## Configuration Options

### Workspace Configuration

- **SKU Options**: Free, Basic, Standard, Premium tiers with different feature sets
- **Network Access**: Public or private endpoint configuration
- **Identity**: System-assigned managed identity for secure resource access

### Compute Cluster Configuration

- **Optional Deployment**: Compute cluster creation can be disabled for workspace-only scenarios
- **VM Configuration**: Configurable VM size (default: Standard_DS3_v2) and priority (default: Dedicated)
- **Auto-scaling**: Minimum/maximum node count with idle timeout (default: 0-1 nodes, 15-minute timeout)
- **Network Integration**: Optional subnet placement for secure network isolation

### AKS Integration Configuration

- **Optional Integration**: AKS cluster attachment can be enabled independently from compute clusters
- **Extension Deployment**: Azure ML extension deployment on AKS cluster for training and inference workloads
- **SSL Configuration**: Automatic certificate generation using Azure-managed domain labels
- **Cluster Purpose**: Configurable purpose (DevTest, DenseProd, FastProd) for performance optimization

## Deployment Scenarios

### Workspace-Only Deployment

Suitable for scenarios where compute resources are managed externally:

```hcl
should_create_compute_cluster = false
```

### Full ML Infrastructure

Complete setup with managed compute resources:

```hcl
should_create_compute_cluster    = true
compute_cluster_vm_size         = "Standard_DS3_v2"
compute_cluster_min_nodes       = 0
compute_cluster_max_nodes       = 4
compute_cluster_idle_duration   = "PT15M"
```

### AKS Integration Deployment

Integrate with existing AKS cluster for scalable ML workloads:

```hcl
should_integrate_aks_cluster          = true
should_enable_azureml_aks_training    = true
should_enable_azureml_aks_inference   = true
aks_cluster_purpose                   = "FastProd"
ssl_leaf_domain_label                 = "my-ml-service"
```

## Integration with Other Components

This component depends on and integrates with:

- **000-resource-group**: Resource organization and management
- **010-security-identity**: Key Vault for secure secret storage
- **020-observability**: Application Insights for workspace monitoring
- **030-data**: Storage Account for ML artifacts and datasets
- **050-networking** (Optional): VNet integration for compute clusters
- **060-acr** (Optional): Container Registry for custom ML environments
- **070-kubernetes** (Optional): AKS cluster for ML training and inference workloads

[Data preparation for grounding data](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/ai/grounding-data-design#data-preparation)\n##### Tools\nWe recommend that you standardize your workload\u0027s data orchestration tools. The tools should be able to provide a data pipeline that can group activities and that has built-in automation.\nAn [Azure Data Factory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-factory/data-factory-overview) pipeline can be an initial choice. It can connect and process many data sources efficiently. You can also consider [Azure Synapse Analytics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/overview-what-is), which combines big data and data warehousing and supports data lakes, Apache Spark, and Azure Synapse SQL. It also integrates with Data Factory for ETL.\nFor preparing training data, [Azure Machine Learning pipelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-ml-pipelines) provide specialized features that can automate tasks like data collection and processing.\nOpen-source technologies like Pandas (for data preparation) and Scrapy are popular choices.\n#### MLOps\nModel training is the process of selecting appropriate algorithms and providing them with preprocessed historical data and observations to enable the model to learn patterns and make predictions.\nTraining the model (feature engineering) and hyperparameter tuning are iterative processes, and they\u0027re expensive. During each iteration, data scientists track results with combinations of data, code, and parameters. **Use repeatable pipelines to track experiments** with minimum manual effort until the right level of accuracy is achieved.\nAnother operational challenge is provisioning and scaling **specialized compute resources** where experiments are conducted. Also, you should **package and publish models** efficiently.\nTeams can start with UI-based development to reduce challenges, and, as they become more confident, transition to a code-based approach.\n##### Tools\nWe recommend that you use tools that can **track machine learning experiments** by capturing details like code versions, environments, parameters, runs, and results. MLflow is one such open-source framework. Consider using Azure Machine Learning workspaces, which are [MLflow-compatible](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-mlflow) and provide a streamlined workflow that enables data scientists to manage productivity and reproducibility in their projects. To manage code development with source control tracking, integrate the machine learning pipeline with source control like GitHub, or use file shares.","contentUrl":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/ai/mlops-genaiops#workload-operations-lifecycle"},{"title":"What is orchestration workflow?","content":"# What is orchestration workflow?\nOrchestration workflow is one of the features offered by [Azure AI Language](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/language-service/overview). It is a cloud-based API service that applies machine-learning intelligence to enable you to build orchestration models to connect [Conversational Language Understanding (CLU)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/language-service/conversational-language-understanding/overview), [Question Answering](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/language-service/question-answering/overview) projects and [LUIS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/luis/what-is-luis) applications. By creating an orchestration workflow, developers can iteratively tag utterances, train and evaluate model performance before making it available for consumption. To simplify building and customizing your model, the service offers a custom web portal that can be accessed through the [Language studio](https://aka.ms/languageStudio). You can easily get started with the service by following the steps in this [quickstart](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/language-service/orchestration-workflow/quickstart).\nThis documentation contains the following article types:\n1. [Quickstarts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/language-service/orchestration-workflow/quickstart) are getting-started instructions to guide you through making requests to the service.\n2. [Concepts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/language-service/orchestration-workflow/concepts/evaluation-metrics) provide explanations of the service functionality and features.\n3. [How-to guides](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/language-service/orchestration-workflow/how-to/create-project) contain instructions for using the service in more specific or customized ways.\n## Example usage scenarios\nOrchestration workflow can be used in multiple scenarios across a variety of industries. Some examples are:\n### Enterprise chat bot\nIn a large corporation, an enterprise chat bot might handle a variety of employee affairs. It might be able to handle frequently asked questions served by a custom question answering knowledge base, a calendar specific skill served by conversational language understanding, and an interview feedback skill served by LUIS. The bot needs to be able to appropriately route incoming requests to the correct service. Orchestration workflow allows you to connect those skills to one project that handles the routing of incoming requests appropriately to power the enterprise bot.","contentUrl":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/language-service/orchestration-workflow/overview"},{"title":"Concepts - Machine learning operations (MLOps) for AI and machine learning workflows","content":"# Concepts - Machine learning operations (MLOps) for AI and machine learning workflows\nIn this article, you learn about machine learning operations (MLOps), including what types of practices and tools are involved, and how it can simplify and speed up your AI and machine learning workflows on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).\n## What is MLOps?\nMachine learning operations (MLOps) encompasses practices that facilitate collaboration between data scientists, IT operations, and business stakeholders, ensuring that machine learning models are developed, deployed, and maintained efficiently. MLOps applies DevOps principles to machine learning projects, aiming to automate and streamline the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. This lifecycle includes training, packaging, validating, deploying, monitoring, and retraining models.\nMLOps requires multiple roles and tools to work together effectively. Data scientists focus on tasks related to training the model, which is referred to as the ***inner loop***. Machine learning engineers and IT operations teams handle the ***outer loop***, where they apply DevOps practices to package, validate, deploy, and monitor models. When the model needs fine-tuning or retraining, the process loops back to the inner loop.\n### MLOps pipeline\nYour MLOps pipeline may leverage various tools and microservices that are deployed sequentially or in parallel. Below are examples of key components in your pipeline that benefit from implementing the following best practices to reduce overhead and allow for faster iteration:\n1. Unstructured data store for new data flowing into your application\n2. Vector database to store and query structured, pre-processed data\n3. Data ingestion and indexing framework\n4. Vector ingestion and/or model retraining workflows\n5. Metrics collection and alerting tools (tracking model performance, volume of ingested data, etc.)\n6. Lifecycle management tools","contentUrl":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/concepts-machine-learning-ops"},{"title":"View orchestration workflow model details","content":"# View orchestration workflow model details\nAfter model training is completed, you can view your model details and see how well it performs against the test set. Observing how well your model performed is called evaluation. The test set consists of data that wasn\u0027t introduced to the model during the training process.\nNote\nUsing the **Automatically split the testing set from training data** option may result in different model evaluation result every time you [train a new model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/language-service/orchestration-workflow/how-to/train-model), as the test set is selected randomly from your utterances. To make sure that the evaluation is calculated on the same test set every time you train a model, make sure to use the **Use a manual split of training and testing data** option when starting a training job and define your **Testing set** when [add your utterances](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/language-service/orchestration-workflow/how-to/tag-utterances).\n## Prerequisites\nBefore viewing a model\u0027s evaluation, you need:\n1. [An orchestration workflow project](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/language-service/orchestration-workflow/how-to/create-project).\n2. A successfully [trained model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/language-service/orchestration-workflow/how-to/train-model)\nSee the [project development lifecycle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/language-service/orchestration-workflow/overview#project-development-lifecycle) for more information.","contentUrl":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/language-service/orchestration-workflow/how-to/view-model-evaluation"},{"title":"MLOps and GenAIOps for AI workloads on Azure","content":"# MLOps and GenAIOps for AI workloads on Azure\n## Workload operations lifecycle\nThe hosting compute can also influence your choice of a workflow orchestrator. If your application is hosted on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), consider using Kubeflow.\nIf you\u0027re considering Azure Machine Learning, we recommend that you start with the [Azure Well-Architected Framework perspective on Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/service-guides/azure-machine-learning) to make sure you understand how the product can help you with the Well-Architected Framework quality concerns of the workload.\nPart of the benefit of the process is to optimize personal time. Data scientists typically need specific tools and SDKs to effectively conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) and experimentation from their workstations. Evaluate whether prebuilt options in Azure Machine Learning are suitable. If not, store workstation configuration or maintain approved VM images for this work. One example of an image that you can use as a starting point is the [Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/overview).\nIn certain cases, the use of VMs might be disallowed by policy. Look for alternatives, like adding Microsoft Dev Box and Azure Virtual Desktop. You can also consider using Docker to bootstrap machines that contain prebuilt images.\nHowever, as this stage matures and you need extended experiments, move to managed compute instances and prefer options that are integrated as part of the workflow. Evaluate whether you can use [Azure Machine Learning compute instances](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-compute-instance) for training and inferencing for development and testing purposes. The compute clusters can handle large datasets and complex models.\nAzure Machine Learning provides both code-based solutions through the SDK and low-code options like automated machine learning and the visual designer. The Python SDK offers multiple ways to train models, each with distinct features. Machine Learning also supports advanced optimization and distributed computing technologies like ONNX Runtime Training\u0027s ORTModule, DeepSpeed, and LoRA to speed up the training process.\n#### GenAIOps\nKey activities during this stage begin with **discovering and evaluating existing models** to identify one that\u0027s pretrained for the specific use case. This is an iterative process. After you find a suitable model, it might benefit from being refined for domain-specific grounding, which also involves iterative steps and requires a certain level of orchestration.","contentUrl":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/ai/mlops-genaiops#workload-operations-lifecycle"},{"title":"MLOps workflows on Azure Databricks","content":"# MLOps workflows on Azure Databricks\n## Recommended MLOps workflow\nThe following sections describe a typical MLOps workflow, covering each of the three stages: development, staging, and production.\nThis section uses the terms \u201Cdata scientist\u201D and \u201CML engineer\u201D as archetypal personas; specific roles and responsibilities in the MLOps workflow will vary between teams and organizations.\n## Development stage\nThe focus of the development stage is experimentation. Data scientists develop features and models and run experiments to optimize model performance. The output of the development process is ML pipeline code that can include feature computation, model training, inference, and monitoring.\n![MLOps development stage diagram](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_static/images/machine-learning/mlops-dev-diagram.png)\nThe numbered steps correspond to the numbers shown in the diagram.\n### 1. Data sources\nThe development environment is represented by the dev catalog in Unity Catalog. Data scientists have read-write access to the dev catalog as they create temporary data and feature tables in the development workspace. Models created in the development stage are registered to the dev catalog.\nIdeally, data scientists working in the development workspace also have read-only access to production data in the prod catalog. Allowing data scientists read access to production data, inference tables, and metric tables in the prod catalog enables them to analyze current production model predictions and performance. Data scientists should also be able to load production models for experimentation and analysis.\nIf it is not possible to grant read-only access to the prod catalog, a snapshot of production data can be written to the dev catalog to enable data scientists to develop and evaluate project code.\n### 2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)\nData scientists explore and analyze data in an interactive, iterative process using notebooks. The goal is to assess whether the available data has the potential to solve the business problem. In this step, the data scientist begins identifying data preparation and featurization steps for model training. This ad hoc process is generally not part of a pipeline that will be deployed in other execution environments.\n[AutoML](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/machine-learning/automl/) accelerates this process by generating baseline models for a dataset. AutoML performs and records a set of trials and provides a Python notebook with the source code for each trial run, so you can review, reproduce, and modify the code. AutoML also calculates summary statistics on your dataset and saves this information in a notebook that you can review.\n### 3. Code\nThe code repository contains all of the pipelines, modules, and other project files for an ML project. Data scientists create new or updated pipelines in a development (\u201Cdev\u201D) branch of the project repository. Starting from EDA and the initial phases of a project, data scientists should work in a repository to share code and track changes.\n### 4. Train model (development)","contentUrl":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/machine-learning/mlops/mlops-workflow#recommended-mlops-workflow"},{"title":"MLOps and GenAIOps for AI workloads on Azure","content":"# MLOps and GenAIOps for AI workloads on Azure\n## Workload operations lifecycle\nIntegrating and deploying models requires specialized tools and practices that go beyond traditional MLOps capabilities, including orchestrating models, vector indexes, prompts, and code blocks.\n##### Tools\nTo address discovery tasks, take advantage of model catalogs that include models from various providers. The [model catalog in Azure AI Foundry portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/how-to/model-catalog-overview) allows you to evaluate from among curated collections and deploy models efficiently.\n[Azure Machine Learning prompt flow](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/prompt-flow/overview-what-is-prompt-flow) can help with the development of orchestration code, enabling prototyping, experimenting, iterating, and prompt engineering. These flows can be deployed to Azure Machine Learning managed endpoints. Evaluate whether you can run and deploy the flows with your existing CI/CD pipeline technology.\n#### Deployment\nDuring this stage, the model is deployed to a hosting and inferencing platform or the serve layer of AI workloads. The APIs need to be packaged as a scalable container. The container platform can be a managed compute or custom hosting platform. Operational practices should ensure safe deployment and enable rollbacks.\nStart with platform as a service (PaaS) and serverless solutions like Azure OpenAI in Foundry Models to simplify adoption and management. Consider using the Azure Machine Learning Serverless API for aggregating endpoint access. Managed compute clusters are a viable option for advanced needs. Self-hosting on AKS is another option. Make sure you right-size your compute and maintain proper isolation from other workloads. You can also consider options like fully hosting your model as infrastructure as a service (IaaS). IaaS provides flexibility but can add operational burden. These options are described in [Application platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/ai/application-platform#online-inferencing).\nThis stage presents the last chance to catch issues before you move the model to production. Test processes should include validation steps to make sure the model is configured to provide predictions as expected.\nYou should integrate the model into the existing production environment by following **progressive exposure processes and using side-by-side deployments**. The canary model is a common way to roll out new models. With this method, the user base is increased gradually. Blue-green deployment is another method.\n##### Tools","contentUrl":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/ai/mlops-genaiops#workload-operations-lifecycle"},{"title":"MLOps Stacks: model development process as code","content":"# MLOps Stacks: model development process as code\n## How does MLOps Stacks work?\n2. ML resources as code. MLOps Stacks defines resources such as workspaces and pipelines for tasks like training and batch inference. Resources are defined in Databricks Asset Bundles to facilitate testing, optimization, and version control for the ML environment. For example, you can try a larger instance type for automated model retraining, and the change is automatically tracked for future reference.\n3. CI/CD. You can use GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps to test and deploy ML code and resources, ensuring that all production changes are performed through automation and that only tested code is deployed to prod.\n## MLOps project flow\nA default MLOps Stacks project includes an ML pipeline with CI/CD workflows to test and deploy automated model training and batch inference jobs across development, staging, and production Databricks workspaces. MLOps Stacks is configurable, so you can modify the project structure to meet your organization\u0027s processes.\nThe diagram shows the process that is implemented by the default MLOps Stack. In the development workspace, data scientists iterate on ML code and file pull requests (PRs). PRs trigger unit tests and integration tests in an isolated staging Databricks workspace. When a PR is merged to main, model training and batch inference jobs that run in staging immediately update to run the latest code. After you merge a PR into main, you can cut a new release branch as part of your scheduled release process and deploy the code changes to production.\n![overall mlops flow diagram](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/_static/images/machine-learning/mlops-stack-summary.png)","contentUrl":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/machine-learning/mlops/mlops-stacks#how-does-mlops-stacks-work"},{"title":"MLOps workflows on Azure Databricks","content":"# MLOps workflows on Azure Databricks\n## Production stage\nThis architecture supports automatic retraining using the same model training pipeline above. Databricks recommends beginning with scheduled, periodic retraining and moving to triggered retraining when needed.\n1. **Scheduled.** If new data is available on a regular basis, you can create a scheduled job to run the model training code on the latest available data. See [Automating jobs with schedules and triggers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/jobs/triggers)\n2. **Triggered.** If the monitoring pipeline can identify model performance issues and send alerts, it can also trigger retraining. For example, if the distribution of incoming data changes significantly or if the model performance degrades, automatic retraining and redeployment can boost model performance with minimal human intervention. This can be achieved through a SQL alert to check whether a metric is anomalous (for example, check drift or model quality against a threshold). The alert can be configured to use a webhook destination, which can subsequently trigger the training workflow.\nIf the retraining pipeline or other pipelines exhibit performance issues, the data scientist may need to return to the development environment for additional experimentation to address the issues.","contentUrl":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/machine-learning/mlops/mlops-workflow#production-stage"},{"title":"MLOps workflows on Azure Databricks","content":"# MLOps workflows on Azure Databricks\nThis article describes how you can use MLOps on the Databricks platform to optimize the performance and long-term efficiency of your machine learning (ML) systems.

Based on my comprehensive research of the existing MLOps ROS2 Robot Edge Architecture research document and additional analysis of the edge-ai repository structure, here are the **critical insights for building a full-loop MLOps architecture diagram**:

## **🎯 Critical Architecture Blocks for Full-Loop MLOps**

### **✅ Strong Foundation Already Exists**
The edge-ai repository provides an **excellent foundation** with:
- **Complete AzureML Infrastructure** (src/000-cloud/080-azureml/) - workspace, compute clusters, model registry, AKS integration
- **Edge Data Collection** (src/100-edge/110-iot-ops/) - Arc-connected K3s with MQTT broker, OPC UA support
- **Cloud Analytics** (src/000-cloud/031-fabric/) - real-time analytics with Eventhouse and KQL databases
- **Container Infrastructure** (src/000-cloud/060-acr/) - premium registry with private networking

### **❌ Critical Missing Blocks in Edge-AI**

#### **🔴 High Priority Gaps - Core Data Flow**
1. **ROS2 to Cloud Connectivity** - No ROS2 message bridge to Azure IoT Operations
2. **Video Streaming Infrastructure** - No robot video streaming to cloud analytics
3. **Edge ML Runtime** - No containerized ML inference runtime for robots

#### **🟡 Medium Priority Gaps - MLOps Workflow**
4. **GitOps MLOps Deployment** - No automated model deployment via FluxCD/ArgoCD
5. **Multi-Environment Validation** - No simulation→AKS→edge→production validation pipeline
6. **Robot Fleet Management** - No robot-specific deployment patterns

#### **🔵 Lower Priority Gaps - Advanced Training**
7. **Isaac Sim Integration** - No simulation environment integration with cloud MLOps
8. **OSMO Alternative** - NVIDIA OSMO doesn't exist publicly; need Azure MLOps alternatives

### **🚀 Ready-for-Implementation Components Identified**

The research has identified **7 new components** ready for implementation:

#### **📦 Application Components (src/500-application/)**
- **520-ros2-aio-connector** - ROS2 to Azure IoT Operations MQTT Bridge
- **521-ros2-video-acsa** - ROS2 Video Streaming to Azure Container Storage  
- **510-robot-ml-runtime** - Containerized ML Model Runtime for Robot Edge AI

#### **🔧 Utility Components (src/900-tools-utilities/)**
- **910-simulation-training** - Azure MLOps + Isaac Sim Integration (OSMO replacement)
- **920-model-validation** - Multi-Environment Validation Pipeline
- **930-gitops-mlops** - General GitOps Deployment Patterns for MLOps
- **940-robot-ml-deployment** - Robot-Specific ML Deployment with GitOps

### **🏗️ Architecture Integration Points**

**Existing Components to Leverage:**
- **000-cloud/080-azureml**: Core training infrastructure with AKS compute targets
- **000-cloud/031-fabric**: Real-time data ingestion and analytics for model monitoring  
- **000-cloud/060-acr**: Model containerization and distribution hub
- **100-edge/110-iot-ops**: Edge data collection and Arc-enabled cluster management

**Required Component Enhancements:**
- **000-cloud/031-fabric**: Enhanced with IL/RL data processing capabilities
- **000-cloud/060-acr**: Enhanced with FluxCD GitOps deployment patterns

### **⚠️ Critical Finding - OSMO Technology Gap**

**No evidence found** that NVIDIA OSMO exists as a publicly available technology. This represents a **critical architecture decision point**:

**✅ Viable Alternatives:**
- Azure Machine Learning pipelines with distributed training
- Azure Databricks MLOps with automated retraining and CI/CD
- Kubeflow on AKS for ML workflow orchestration
- Apache Airflow for custom MLOps pipeline automation

### **🔄 Remaining Alternative Approaches Requiring Decisions**

1. **Training Orchestration**: 
   - Azure ML pipelines vs. Azure Databricks MLOps vs. Kubeflow
   - **Tradeoffs**: Native Azure integration vs. open-source flexibility vs. Kubernetes-native patterns

2. **Validation Pipeline Strategy**:
   - Progressive deployment (simulation→AKS→edge→production) vs. parallel validation environments
   - **Tradeoffs**: Safety/thoroughness vs. deployment speed vs. infrastructure complexity

3. **GitOps Implementation**:
   - FluxCD (Azure Arc native) vs. ArgoCD (CNCF standard) vs. Azure DevOps GitOps
   - **Tradeoffs**: Azure integration vs. ecosystem standardization vs. enterprise tooling

### **📋 Next Steps for Implementation Planning**

Nothing was deleted or replaced in the research document - only enhanced findings and corrected technology availability.

The research provides complete implementation specifications in specialized sub-research documents for each component, including:
- Complete C# and Python code examples
- Terraform module specifications  
- Helm chart templates
- Container optimization strategies
- Security hardening patterns

**Ready for handoff to task-planner** with comprehensive implementation roadmap and architecture specifications.

</reminderInstructions>
<userRequest>
Assume NVIDIA OSMO is a blackbox, we trigger it through a AzDo pipeline or a GitHub Action. If we are doing IL training then any data will have been gathered into Fabric and processed through prior AzureML jobs (if needed). We will provide this data into OSMO along with a training python script, all specifically meant for IL training. Checkpoints for this trianing will be sent to AzureML through mlflow. Another AzDo pipeline or GitHub action could then be kicked off to do the RL with one of these checkpoint models as a seed model for the training, the training then includes policies and will use IsaacSim for training, Checkpoints will be saved to AzureML through mlflow.

The specific details for these training jobs should be in the sub-research documents. This document should include just a breif overview and anything important. Think about the architecture diagram that will specifically list out this full MLOps (loop) flow, it should include specific Azure Services (and what components they come from), it should have arrows with a description of the action or trigger from on Service to the next, any workloads or jobs should be specifically called out which services they correspond to.
