agreaves-ms: I would like you to review this document. Then research AzureML by #fetch:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-train-model?view=azureml-api-2&tabs=azurecli. Update the document with information about AzureML.

GitHub Copilot: I'll start by reviewing the document you're currently viewing, then research AzureML using the provided webpage, and finally update the document with the relevant information. Now let me research AzureML training information from the provided webpage: Now I'll update the document with the comprehensive AzureML training information I've gathered from the research. I'll add a new section that covers the model training aspects while maintaining the document's focus on edge Arc integration.

Perfect! I've successfully reviewed the existing document and integrated comprehensive AzureML training information from the Microsoft Learn documentation. Here's a summary of what I added:

## Document Review Summary

The original document was a comprehensive research document focused on **AzureML Edge Arc Integration** with a strong emphasis on:
- Terraform-based edge component design
- Private VNet-only connectivity policies
- SSL/TLS certificate management via Azure Key Vault
- Integration with Arc-enabled Kubernetes clusters

## AzureML Training Integration Added

I've added a new major section **"ðŸ¤– AzureML Model Training Integration"** that includes:

### 1. **Training Job Submission & Management**
- Azure CLI v2, Python SDK v2, and REST API methods
- Job configuration examples with YAML schema
- Command-line examples for workspace connection and job submission

### 2. **Compute Resources & Scaling**
- Azure Machine Learning Compute Clusters configuration
- Serverless compute options
- Arc-enabled Kubernetes integration for edge scenarios

### 3. **MLflow Model Registration**
- Model lifecycle management with MLflow format
- Version control and metadata tracking
- Deployment-ready model packaging

### 4. **Edge Training Considerations**
- Integration points with the existing Arc component architecture
- Private network training workflows
- SSL/TLS security considerations
- Data flow architecture diagram
- Operational benefits for hybrid cloud-edge scenarios

## Key Value Additions

The new content maintains alignment with the document's existing policies:
- **Private-only connectivity** maintained for training workflows
- **SSE integration** extended to training authentication
- **Component architecture** enhanced with training workflow considerations
- **Security-first design** applied to model training scenarios

The integration provides a complete picture of how Azure Machine Learning training capabilities can be leveraged within the secure, private edge infrastructure described in the original document.
