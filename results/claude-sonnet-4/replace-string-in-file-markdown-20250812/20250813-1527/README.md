# Replace String In File 20250813-1527

Looking at [007-editAgent](./007-editAgent.copilotmd) `replace_string_in_file` tried to update `"oldString": "### AzureML Arc Extension Configuration (validated from Microsoft Learn)"` which didn't exist in the file.

[008-healStringReplace](./008-healStringReplace.copilotmd) then decided to replace `"corrected_target_snippet": "AzureML Arc Extension Configuration (validated from Microsoft Learn)"` which made the change in the wrong place.

## Important

Reviewing [010-editAgent](./010-editAgent.copilotmd) shows that Claude would have no way of knowing that `"oldString"` originally: `"### AzureML Arc Extension Configuration (validated from Microsoft Learn)"` was turned into `"AzureML Arc Extension Configuration (validated from Microsoft Learn)"`. So it assumes that it made the correct change, when the suggested snippit from gpt-4o-mini actually ended up corrupting my markdown.
