### User
~~~md
Context: A process needs to find an exact literal, unique match for a specific text snippet within a file's content. The provided snippet failed to match exactly. This is most likely because it has been overly escaped.

Task: Analyze the provided file content and the problematic target snippet. Identify the segment in the file content that the snippet was *most likely* intended to match. Output the *exact*, literal text of that segment from the file content. Focus *only* on removing extra escape characters and correcting formatting, whitespace, or minor differences to achieve a PERFECT literal match. The output must be the exact literal text as it appears in the file.

Problematic target snippet:
```

# Task Research Documents: AzureML Edge Arc Integration

🎯 Comprehensive research to design a new Terraform-only edge component that integrates Azure Machine Learning with Arc-enabled Kubernetes. The component must mirror the cloud component structure, store AzureML SSL material as Key Vault secrets (in the edge component), and rely on Kubernetes resources (namespace, SecretProviderClass, SecretSync) applied by the IoT Operations edge component.

## 📋 Policy Framework

- **SSE-Only Policy**: This solution standardizes on the Azure Key Vault Secret Store extension (SSE) for secret synchronization. Other approaches (e.g., online-only AKV Secrets Provider) are out of scope.
- **Private-Only Connectivity**: Only private VNet connectivity is supported. Public internet access to the AzureML workspace or Arc-exposed services (including `public_network_access_enabled = true` or LoadBalancer endpoints) is explicitly NOT supported. All endpoint exposure patterns MUST remain within private address spaces reachable via same VNet, peering, hub-spoke, or approved private connectivity (VPN/ExpressRoute) only.
- **Security-First Design**: No secret values in Terraform outputs; TLS enabled by default; strict private connectivity; NodePort restricted via private NSGs/firewalls.

## Outline

🎯 **Research Scope**: Design and validate a new Terraform-only edge component `src/100-edge/140-azureml/terraform` that integrates Azure Machine Learning with Arc-enabled Kubernetes, following established project patterns.

🏗️ **Technical Architecture Validated**:
- Arc extension resource (`azurerm_arc_kubernetes_cluster_extension`) with `Microsoft.AzureML.Kubernetes` type
- Workspace attachment (`azurerm_machine_learning_inference_cluster`) for Arc cluster registration
- SSL/TLS flow: Key Vault → SSE → Kubernetes Secret → AML Extension configuration
- Component structure mirroring cloud AzureML component with edge-specific modules

🔑 **Key Findings**:
- All API versions and configuration keys confirmed from authoritative Microsoft Learn sources
- SSE CRDs and secret synchronization patterns established and validated
- Private VNet-only configuration requirements documented (public access excluded from scope)
- Security-first defaults with private connectivity and NodePort service restriction

✅ **Implementation Readiness**:
- Dependencies identified and validated against existing components
- Complete file structure and variable organization designed
- Integration scripts pattern established for IoT Operations coordination
- Network security options evaluated and selected

## Scope and Success Criteria

- **Scope**: Design a new Terraform edge component integrating Azure Machine Learning with Arc-enabled Kubernetes, including SSL management via Azure Key Vault and SSE, following established project patterns and conventions
- **Exclusions**: Implementation/scaffolding (implementation planning only), alternative secret sync approaches (SSE-only policy), non-Terraform solutions
- **Assumptions**:
  - Arc cluster has OIDC issuer and workload identity enabled (provided by IoT Operations)
  - Azure Key Vault and AML workspace exist as dependencies
  - Private-only connectivity enforced: cloud workspace and Arc cluster communicate exclusively over private networks (same VNet, peered VNets, hub-spoke, or secured hybrid link)
- **Success Criteria**:
  - ✅ Technical validation of all Azure resources and API versions
  - ✅ Complete component structure design following project conventions
  - ✅ SSL/TLS flow documented with SSE integration pattern
  - ✅ Private VNet-only configuration requirements established (public scenarios excluded)
  - ✅ Implementation guidance with specific file structures and dependencies
  - ✅ Network security patterns evaluated and selected
  - ✅ All technical details backed by authoritative sources with proper references

## 🎯 Recommended Technical Solution

**Selected Architecture**: Create new component `src/100-edge/140-azureml/terraform` following established edge component patterns, with two internal modules and CI wrapper. Store SSL certificates in Key Vault via the 140-azureml component; deploy Kubernetes resources for azureml namespace via 110-iot-ops apply scripts (ServiceAccount, SecretProviderClass, SecretSync). Configure the AML extension with NodePort and TLS using SSE-synced secrets in private VNet scenarios only (no public exposure).

**Key Design Decisions**:
1. **SSE-Only Policy**: Standardize on Secret Store Extension vs. online-only AKV Secrets Provider for consistency with edge/offline scenarios
2. **Private-Only Connectivity**: Public network access for the AML workspace and inference endpoints is not supported; `public_network_access_enabled` remains `false` always; exposure via internal private networking only
3. **Component Separation**: Clear boundaries between Terraform (140-azureml) and Kubernetes manifests (110-iot-ops)
4. **Security-First**: No secret values in Terraform outputs; TLS enabled by default; strict private connectivity; NodePort restricted via private NSGs/firewalls
5. **Operational Simplicity**: Self-signed certificates supported for non-production inside private environments; production requires managed or externally provided certificates; automated sync via SSE

**Implementation Readiness**: All technical dependencies validated, API versions confirmed, and integration patterns established from existing components.

## 🔐 Security, Operational & Advanced Considerations

### Dependency Graph & Ordering
```mermaid
graph TD
  KV[(Key Vault)] --> TLSCerts{Optional TLS Generation}
  TLSCerts --> KVSecrets[azurerm_key_vault_secret]
  ArcCluster[(Arc Connected Cluster)] --> AMLArcExt[azurerm_arc_kubernetes_cluster_extension.azureml]
  AMLWorkspace[(AML Workspace)] --> InferenceAttach[azurerm_machine_learning_inference_cluster.arc]
  AMLArcExt --> InferenceAttach
```

**Key Dependencies**:
- Extension must be deployed before compute target attachment
- Key Vault secrets created independently of extension (SSE handles sync)
- Apply scripts run after Terraform resources are provisioned

### State & Idempotency Considerations
- Pin provider versions in `versions.tf` to mitigate breaking changes
- Avoid `count` for core modules to maintain output stability
- Self-signed cert regeneration controlled via explicit variable changes
- Use lifecycle management only when required by policy

### Security & Least Privilege Controls
- **No Secret Exposure**: Only secret names in outputs, never values
- **Network Restrictions**: NodePort only (LoadBalancer validation prevents public exposure)
- **RBAC Requirements**: Key Vault Secrets User role for SSE UAMI
- **Private Connectivity**: All workspace communication via private networks only

### Certificate Rotation Strategy
**Operational Flow**:
1. Admin updates cert/key in Key Vault (new secret versions)
2. SSE automatically syncs latest enabled versions to cluster
3. AML extension uses updated secrets (may require pod restart)

**Implementation Notes**:
- Stable secret names (no random suffixes)
- No Terraform-managed rotation (manual Key Vault operations)
- Self-signed certificates: re-apply to regenerate requires input changes

```

For example, if the problematic target snippet was "\\\nconst greeting = `Hello \\`${name}\\``;" and the file content had content that looked like "
const greeting = `Hello \`${name}\``;", then corrected_target_snippet should likely be "
const greeting = `Hello \`${name}\``;" to fix the incorrect escaping to match the original file content.
If the differences are only in whitespace or formatting, apply similar whitespace/formatting changes to the corrected_target_snippet.

Return ONLY the corrected target snippet in the specified JSON format with the key 'corrected_target_snippet'. If no clear, unique match can be found, return an empty string for 'corrected_target_snippet'.Your response must follow the JSON format:

	```
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "corrected_target_snippet": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "The corrected version of the target snippet that exactly and uniquely matches a segment within the provided file content."
    }
  },
  "required": [
    "corrected_target_snippet"
  ]
}
```
