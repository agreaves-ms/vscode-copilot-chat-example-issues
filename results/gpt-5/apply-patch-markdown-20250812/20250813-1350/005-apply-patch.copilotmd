 ## 3333 - 🔑 Key Discoveries
@@
 ### Additional Thoughts
+
+These represent forward-looking, synthesis-level considerations that extend beyond prior (1 / 2222) discovery phases—focused on Day-2 reliability, security posture hardening, and minimizing operational friction.
+
+1. Secret Lifecycle & Rotation Strategy
+   - Define rotation cadence (e.g., 90 days) for TLS cert/key when self-signed; enforce via pipeline job invoking terraform taint + reapply + SSE sync verification.
+   - Future enhancement: Introduce optional integration with Azure Key Vault Certificate (AKV cert object) instead of discrete secrets once provider supports streamlined export semantics for edge.
+   - Add drift detection hook: validate Kubernetes secret fingerprint (SHA256 of cert) matches Key Vault latest version; alert on mismatch.
+
+2. Extension Configuration Guardrails
+   - Provide explicit validation (custom terraform validations) restricting `inferenceRouterServiceType` to `NodePort` in edge mode; fail fast on unsupported values.
+   - Expose minimal, opinionated variable surface (e.g., hide advanced extension toggles until justified) to reduce misconfiguration entropy.
+   - Maintain version pinning (extension release train) with a controlled upgrade flag; document rollback pattern (reapply previous version + force replace if schema drift).
+
+3. Failure Mode Focus Areas
+   - Secret sync lag: Implement readiness probe script (kubectl wait + secret key presence) gating extension apply operations.
+   - Partial apply (extension created before secret): mitigate via explicit `depends_on` chain + out-of-band pre-flight check in apply script.
+   - Workspace private endpoint DNS misconfiguration: add diagnostic helper script to resolve AML FQDN internally and assert private IP range.
+
+4. Observability & Tracing Enhancements
+   - Extend 120-observability to tag AML extension pods with `component=azureml-edge` for targeted log routing.
+   - Capture Key Vault secret version used at deployment time as a Terraform output (non-sensitive metadata) for audit traceability.
+   - Consider lightweight synthetic inference call (curl against NodePort via cluster DNS) post-deploy to assert 200 + cert CN match.
+
+5. Security Posture Reinforcements
+   - Enforce namespace-level NetworkPolicy (deny-all + allow required intra-namespace and observability egress) once IoT Ops adds baseline networking CRDs.
+   - Validate ServiceAccount token projection is disabled unless explicitly required (workload identity reduces need for long-lived tokens).
+   - Future: integrate `azurerm_key_vault_access_policy` → shift to RBAC-only model when full provider parity stabilizes to reduce policy sprawl.
+
+6. Operational Runbook Seeds
+   - Rotation: Step-by-step (reissue cert → update KV → confirm SSE secret refresh → restart AML router pod if not auto-reloaded).
+   - Upgrade: Pin new extension version in variable, plan, confirm schema diff minimal, deploy in canary environment ahead of production edge fleets.
+   - Rollback: Revert variable, force replace extension resource if internal state not cleanly downgraded.
+
+7. Testing Strategy Layers
+   - Static validation: `terraform validate` + custom pre-commit for variable invariants (serviceType, public access flags).
+   - Integration (kind/local Arc emulation placeholder) for CI dry-run of manifest templates (lint YAML, ensure placeholders resolved).
+   - Conformance: Post-deploy script asserting (a) secret keys present, (b) extension status = Healthy, (c) NodePort service not externally routable.
+
+8. Drift & Compliance Monitoring
+   - Leverage scheduled terraform plan (read-only) to detect out-of-band edits (e.g., manual extension reconfig) feeding into security dashboard.
+   - Hash and store (in state or artifact) serialized subset of configuration settings; compare on next run for early drift detection even if provider does not flag change.
+
+9. Backlog / Future Enhancements
+   - Add optional managed cert acquisition (ACME private CA) for larger edge fleets.
+   - Introduce zero-downtime extension upgrade orchestration (staggered restart hooks) if future versions support side-by-side.
+   - Provide pluggable policy evaluation (OPA/Gatekeeper) for AML namespace.
+
+10. Assumptions Requiring Explicit Validation Before GA
+   - SSE propagation latency consistently < N minutes (define SLO; gather metrics in pilot).
+   - NodePort exposure remains fully contained within private network segments (validate with network scan in staging environment).
+   - Workload identity path covers all extension cloud calls (no fallback to legacy secrets-based auth).
+
+Overall: No new blockers identified—focus shifts from feasibility to codifying guardrails, automation of rotation/validation workflows, and building a minimal but extensible operational surface.
